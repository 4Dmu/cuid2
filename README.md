# Cuid2

A golang port of the js cuid2 library, the original version can be found [here](https://github.com/paralleldrive/cuid2)

So far the ids are generated fine, and their are no collisions.
However the histogram part of the tests fail,
but I don't know if thats because of bugs in the tests themselves or the actual code.
